        <p>The hiking trails are incredible. There are 37.5 miles of trails in conjunction with Bays Mountain Park, and they feature such things as: an overlook that rises 300â€™ above the park to give you a unique perspective of the surrounding area, old homesteads, an unfinished cabin and smoke house, and two waterfalls. Laurel Falls is a scenic, 20-minute hike up the trail. An additional 20-minute hike will take you to Kiner Creek Falls. Plan on spending the day exploring all we have to offer.</p>
